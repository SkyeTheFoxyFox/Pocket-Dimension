# Pocket Dimensions
This datapack allows you to use a custom item to make, and access boxes in a custom dimension.

Currently you can get the items with this command:

    /give @s minecraft:carrot_on_a_stick{CustomModelData:136,SFpocketid:1}
  
The one at the end is it's id, change that to change which room it takes you to.

Warnings:

The pocket dimensions need to be made sequentially or it will break.

If you die while in a pocket dimension it breaks.

If you die in a pocket dimension, or leave your carrot on a stick in the dimension, you won't be able to access it again without giving it to yourself again.
