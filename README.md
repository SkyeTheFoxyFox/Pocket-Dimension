# Pocket Dimensions
This datapack allows you to use a custom item to make, and access boxes, in a custom dimension.

You can get the items by crafting 4 shulker boxes in the corners, 4 echo shards in the sides, and a god apple in the center.

Thanks to u/Hayey_ for the resource pack!!! :3 

Warnings:

* If you die while in a pocket dimension it breaks.
* If you die in a pocket dimension, or leave your carrot on a stick in the dimension, you won't be able to access it again without giving it to yourself again.
